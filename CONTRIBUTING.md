# Contributing to fizzbuzzx

Thank you for checking out fizzbuzzx! We've put together the following guidelines to help you with the code contribution to the project. 

## What Do I Need to Know to Help? 

If you are looking to help with code contribution, our project uses python3, and tox. 

## How to Contribute

1. Find an issue that you are interested in addressing or a feature that you would like to add.
2. Fork the repository associated with the issue to your local GitHub organization. This means that you will have a copy of the repository under your-GitHub-username/repository-name.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/github-username/repository-name.git.
4. Create a new branch for your fix using git checkout -b branch-name-here.
5. Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the feature that you want to add.
7. Use git commit -m "Insert a short message of the changes made here" to store the contents of the index with a descriptive message. Please also reference the issue that your commit is resolving in the commit message. 
8. Push the changes to the remote repository using git push origin branch-name-here.
9. Submit a pull request to the upstream repository.
10. Title the pull request with a short description of the changes made and the issue or bug number associated with your change. For example, you can title an issue like so "Added more log outputting to resolve #4352".
10. In the description of the pull request, explain the changes that you made, any issues you think exist with the pull request you made, and any questions you have for the maintainer. It's OK if your pull request is not perfect (no pull request is), the reviewer will be able to help you fix any problems and improve it!
11. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer.
12. Make changes to the pull request if the reviewing maintainer recommends them. If no changes are requested then the reviewer will go ahead and merge your pull request. 
13. Celebrate your success after your pull request is merged! ðŸŽ‰
